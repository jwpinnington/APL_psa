## Context:

Our client runs a high volume B2B trading operation with large suppliers and business customers. We have provided a trading platform and other solutions for our client since 2016 (having provided solutions for other clients since 2007). 

 

## Scenario:

We have been asked to build a messaging application for use by our client to support operational dialogue with their suppliers and customers.

You have been asked to scope out the project and to consider different solution options. You have direct access to both the business client and technical teams.

### What would your initial steps be?

* Align solution within business and IT strategy

    VMOST

    | Initial | word      | Business/IT |
    |---------|-----------|-------------|
    | V       | Vision    |  BBBBB      |
    | M       | Mission   |  BBBBB      |
    | O       | Objective |  BBBB/T     |
    | S       | [Strategy](#2)  |  BBB/TT     |
    | T       | [Tactics](#3)   |  B/TTTT     |

    The Scenario exists at the level of a strategy, a messaging application, and an objective which is to support operational dialogue with suppliers and customers.

    The [strategy](#2) is a change state to the objective, strategy is the vector to the objective's scalar. 

    Is the objective extant, or is it a new objective? The context would lead to an assumption of the objective being extant. Much as we wish to talk about the journey into the future we should [map the territory](#1) where we are.

    ~~*“I wouldn’t start from here if I were you.”*~~
