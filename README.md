## Context:

Our client runs a high volume B2B trading operation with large suppliers and business customers. We have provided a trading platform and other solutions for our client since 2016 (having provided solutions for other clients since 2007). 

 

## Scenario:

We have been asked to build a messaging application for use by our client to support operational dialogue with their suppliers and customers.

You have been asked to scope out the project and to consider different solution options. You have direct access to both the business client and technical teams.

### What would your initial steps be?

### What would you expect the key success criteria to be?
### What constraints and barriers might you face?

### At a high level, what architectural options might be relevant in this scenario?

### How might our clientâ€™s B2B environment and reliance on our existing systems impact on your recommendations?

### What project phases would you propose?

### What technologies would you consider and how would you narrow down to final recommendations? What factors would you consider and who would you involve in this?
